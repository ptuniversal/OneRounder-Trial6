<div class="aboutUs">

The four of us, Maci, Pashvi, Aiden,and Ursula met in English class with no exact direction as to where to go with our invention for our project. 
We start listing issues we have in our everyday lives. 
Nothing seemed good until someone named the issue of taking multiple trips back and forth from the car to the house with the grocery bags. 
That was the spark to a world of ideas for this project. We started our company One Rounder in 2013 and customers have been satisfied ever since. 
Today, millions of customers are happily taking in their groceries in one trip with the One Rounder.
